        <p>
          Flix has a unique effect system that precisely tracks pure, impure,
          and effect polymorphic functions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The effect system enables the Flix compiler to warn about the
          following program:
        </p>

        <Editor flix={this.props.flix}>
          {`def main(): Int =
    List.map(x -> x + 1, 1 :: 2 :: Nil);
    123`}
        </Editor>

        <p>
          which when compiled (with redundancy checks enabled) gives the
          following error message:
        </p>

        <Editor flix={this.props.flix}>
          {`-- Redundancy Error -------------------------------------------------- ???

>> Useless expression: It has no side-effect(s) and its result is discarded.

2 |     List.map(x -> x + 1, 1 :: 2 :: Nil);
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        useless expression.


Possible fixes:

  (1)  Use the result computed by the expression.
  (2)  Remove the expression statement.
  (3)  Introduce a let-binding with a wildcard name.`}
        </Editor>

        <p>
          The problem with the above program is that the <Code>map</Code>{' '}
          expression in the expression statement has no side-effect and its
          result is silent discarded: it is redundant code. Probably the
          programmer wanted the result to be used somehow.
        </p>

        <p>
          NB: The above warning may not appear in the online evaluator (because
          redundancy checks are disabled for convenience). If so, go to the Flix
          playground at <a href="https://play.flix.dev/">play.flix.dev</a> and
          de-select (allow) "unused code". You should now be able to see the
          same error message.
